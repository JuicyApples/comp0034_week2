# COMP0034 Week 2: Intro to HTML, CSS and Plotly Dash

## Set-up

1. Accept the GitHub classroom assignment
2. Clone the repository in your IDE
3. Create and activate a venv e.g. `python3 -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the libraries from requirements.txt e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

PyCharm and VS Code provide built in support for CSS and HTML.

You may find that an online editor such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) is more
convenient to quickly write and see HTML and CSS combined.
