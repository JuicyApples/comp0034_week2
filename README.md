# COMP0034 Week 2: Intro to HTML, CSS and Plotly Dash

## Activities

1. [Lab 2 instructions](/activities/lab_2.md)
2. [Introduction to HTML](/activities/html_intro.md)
3. [Introduction to CSS](/activities/css_intro.md)
4. [Introduction to Plotly Dash](/activities/plotly_dash_intro.md)

The `html_css_intro` directory contains code examples associated with the activities and other teaching materials on
Moodle.

## Set-up

1. Fork the GitHub classroom repository
2. Clone the forked repository in your IDE
3. _Create_ and _activate_ a venv e.g. `python3 -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac)
   or `.\env\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install the libraries from requirements.txt e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

PyCharm and VS Code provide built in support for CSS and HTML.

An online editor e.g., [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), may be more
convenient to quickly write and see HTML and CSS combined.
