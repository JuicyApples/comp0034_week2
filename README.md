# comp0034_week2

The activities for this week do not require Python so you do not need to add a venv to your project.

You will need a code editor that can view and edit HTML and CSS. Jupyter notebooks are not suited to this, you would need to use an IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, or an online editor such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) which can be convenient to quickly write and see HTML and CSS combined.

The `web_app_intro` directory contains examples of html and css that are consistent with the lecture notes. Use these to follow along with the lecturer and modify them as you wish to see the effect of changes.
